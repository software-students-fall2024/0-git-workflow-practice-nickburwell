## Thoughts 
Above is a link to an article that explores a front end web designers thoughts and feelings about being a creative. He explores the inconsisency and volatility of his creative output. This article was interesting because although you do often hear people discuss engineering from this creative/artistic standpoint, disscusion about the emotional side of the creative process is not as popular. Thats often a conversation reserved for more traditional creatives like singers, artists, and actors just to name a few. So, in the end this article is an intimate exploration of the creative process as it relates to software engineering. 


***Comment***
I like how this article encourages us to embrace our creative impulses and emotions, and in a way, use them to our advantage in the creative process.
